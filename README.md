# NextCord-Youtube-Notification-Bot

This is a Discord bot able to use webhooks rewritten in NextCord and saving data through SQLite3.

The original repo belongs to [AdvicSaha443](https://github.com/AdvicSaha443)

This requires you to update the database manually. I would recommend getting [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to edit the database for this.
